          <p>The Bitwise Workforce training provides many possibilities. For the moment, by goal is to continue to take the classes offered and begin on a new website,to replace my old one with a new design and purpose. Once that is finished I have a domain I will work on with a designer, Sore Loser.me and Sore Loser.org. Our original intention is to create a platform that showcases politicians and athletes that fall into this category by their words and actions.</p>

          <p class="sect2">My inspiration for photography came from people like Ansel Adams, Edward Weston, Dorothea Lange and Paul Bishop. These people were masters of Black and White photography. I had the good fortune of studying portrait photography from Paul Bishop in Berkeley. His understanding of the use of lighting was masterful. My work with him was part of a program to become a commercial photographer. A two-year program in commercial photography offered by UC Extension. The course included model and product photography.</p>

          <p>Finishing the program, I photographed products for different corporations located in the central valley. This was fun and took me on different locations. Photographing Keller doors took me to Jamestown to shoot amongst the old trains. We took metal detectors from Fisher industries into the old gold prospecting areas off highway 49. My jobs included photographing Malibu boars and hot tubs, and in San Francisco working with a commercial photographer on a Macy’s catalogue.</p> 
            
          <p>The experience of running a small business was challenging and, in the end, as much as I enjoyed the creative work I had to choose between two different careers, photography for teaching. Teaching won, for even at my college I was given the opportunity to teach photography. Today, I photograph for fun and personal joy.</p>

          <p class="sect2">My life-time career ambition was to be a college professor. I began at Fresno State as a history professor, a year later I was hired by Merced College to create, with seven other instructors, a new campus in Los Banos. My job gradually migrated to the Merced campus. There I taught history, political science, economics and occasionally photography.</p> 

          <p>The courses were the first two-years of undergraduate studies, often considered by students hard. Economics and political science required creative thinking, problem solving, communication skills and open-mindedness. Skills similar to coding. My joy was helping students navigate the material and through writing clarify their arguments and solutions to the problems they were given.</p> 
            
          <p>Each of the thirty-three years was a new experience with new inquisitive students seeking knowledge and a path to their future careers. Watching students move on to four-year institutions and coming back with careers is part of the joy of teaching. Moving from Merced to Fresno gave me the opportunity to go back to CSU Fresno and teach exclusively political science. Retiring from Merced College, I continued teaching at Fresno State for another five years. Teaching was clearly a passion. The question, what next?</p>

          <p class="sect2">Photography was by inspiration, teaching was my passion and commitment has become coding. Three months ago, my wife received an email from Bitwise offering virtual courses in coding. She placed the email on my desk and kept encouraging me to sign up. With no knowledge of coding, I took the dive and registered. Website for beginners was challenging and motivated me to go beyond what was being taught, diving into you tube and finding visual instruction to supplement what we were learning. Six weeks flew by and it became obvious that I wanted to know more and signed up for the Mobile Friendly Website (MFW), virtual course. </p>

          <p> wish is that there would be a course after MFW that was a combination of both courses at an intermediate level that taught the more complicated html, CSS, and bootstrap coding together with mastering use of the terminal.  Clearly, the instructors of both classes have motivated me to go beyond the course material.</p> 
            
          <p>JavaScript is the next class I will sign up for. I look for learning another form of coding. I appreciate that the classes are virtual and would urge you find a way to continue with this mode when you return to the building. My personal goal is combining all that I’ve learned and finally rebuild my old website that is quietly dying in the cloud since the program I created it in is deceased!</p>
