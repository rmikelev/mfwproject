          <h5 class="p m-2 font-weight-light text-center text-success text-uppercase">The assassination of Robert Kennedy, Ambassador Hotel, June 5, 1968</h5>
          <p class="sect2">We have choice over our lives but not that of others or the events that occur that we have no control or influence on. From the time I was born till the death of Robert Kennedy on June 5, 1968 I lived through the first atomic bombs used on another country and visited Nagasaki Japan and saw the first blade of grass growing twenty-two years before the bomb exploded. I saw the assassination of John F. Kennedy, November 22, 1963, heard M.L. King speak at UCLA, April, 1965, watched MLK’s assignation and was in front of Robert Kennedy 30 minutes before his assassination, photographing the event.</p>

          <p>My heroes were all assassinated. Their deaths were like an underground earthquake that not only shakes up reality but creates new vault lines that impact people, leaders and nations. We can choose to be silent, pretend not to know what is happening in the world or become involved and vulnerable, knowing nothing venture means nothing gained.</p>

          <img src="./images/Clinton.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="President Bill Clinton">
          <h5 class="p m-2 font-weight-light text-center text-success text-uppercase">President Clinton, 2016</h5>
          <p class="sect2">This image of President Clinton was taken when he visited Fresno in 2016 campaigning for his wife running for President and I took my young daughter to meet him. I had the good fortune of going to President Clinton’s second inaugural in 1967. A day of amazing festivities watching a President being sworn into office culminating seeming him at one of the inaugural balls where he played his sax for the audience.</p>

          <p>I see myself as neither an optimist or pessimist but a realist. I genuinely had hope that life would improve and America would reap the benefits of technology, medicine and agriculture for our nation. Instead a conservative fission was unleashed with the assassinations of JFK, MLK and Robert Kennedy metastasizing with the election of Barack Obama. For a moment, there was hope. America would deal with its institutional racism and economic equality would become a future reality.</p>
            
          <p>The election of 2016, ended the dream and unleashed an ugliness in the American polity that in spite of the election of November, 2020 that elected President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris unleashed an insurrection on the Capital of United States on January 6, 2021.</p>

          <h5 class="p m-2 font-weight-light text-center text-success text-uppercase">Attack on America, January 6, 2021</h5>
          <p class="sect2">The events leading up to the Insurrection of January 6, 2021 continue to play out today. The details are well known and this is not the place to rehash the obvious. However, this event demonstrates how our past defines the present. We choose our path and stay the course to the ends we intended or not. What is hard to avoid are the colliding factors created by others as their path, not yours yet affecting the route you have chosen to take. We have to deal with the realities and find a healthy way to provide and protect the journey we are on.</p>
